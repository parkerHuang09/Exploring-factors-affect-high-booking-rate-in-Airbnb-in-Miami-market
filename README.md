# Exploring-factors-affect-high-booking-rate-in-Airbnb-in-Miami-market

Description

This is my final project for course "Data Mining &amp; Predictive Analysis" at University of Maryland. (2020.05).
We did a deep analysis on the Airbnb Miami market date using spatial mapping, classification, text mining, and modeling techniques. 
After deeply and carefully analyzing these factors, we concluded that three factors we mention have substantial impacts on properties being frequently booked and can potentially create huge profit for investors if they follow our recommendations.

Conclusion

As a nutshell, we conclude our findings as follows: To achieve a high booking rate,
1. Select a nice location. For a safe and long term investment, beachfront is always the best choice! Besides that, somewhere around the center also looks promising. However, because of lacking suﬀicient data, this recommedation should be taken with caution and only for risk seekers: The low observations and comparably high booking rate within those locations indicates they could be very promising new lands which are blind spots to other common players. Chances are that investors could earn a great amount from those places.
2. Fill in the amenities and cover up all 7 dimensions we generalized as much as possible:
• Entertaining • Key features • Pet allowance • Safety
• Essentials
• Specialty
• Property Design
3. Fill in the available transportation options around your properties. Mention about how convenient to reach transportation from your properties will benefit the booking rate. Mentioning public trans- portation is good, but mentioning private transportation options such as pickup services and rental car services availability are far better!
